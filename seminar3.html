                        <h3>Career Development Program for Engineering Students</h3>
                        <p class="speaker-name">Speaker: ENGR. ADRIAN FERDINAND M. MELO</p>
                        <p>That seminar with Engr. Melo was a real wake-up call for how I'm thinking about getting ready for my career. He had this really organized but also thoughtful way of explaining that figuring out your career starts with knowing yourself – like, really understanding what you're good at and what you need to work on. I actually found those tools he talked about, like SWOT analysis and setting SMART goals, to be way more useful than I thought. They actually made me rethink how I even set goals and try to reach them. But what really stuck with me was when he stressed that those "soft skills" – you know, like talking to people and working in a team – are just as important as all the technical stuff we're learning. He also pushed us to actually get involved in communities and organizations, not just to put it on our resume, but to actually get some real-world experience and make connections. The big takeaway for me was that building a career isn't just something that happens after we graduate. It's something we need to be actively working on now, by planning, learning, and getting out there.</p>

                        <h3>How to Carve Early Career Path</h3>
                        <p class="speaker-name">Speaker: MR. JOHN DERECK B. AGUILERA</p>
                        <p>Mr. Aguilera's seminar really messed with my head in the best way possible, you know? It wasn't just about landing a cool job title or getting all the technical stuff down. He made me really think about the kind of person I want to be, and the kind of engineer too. That question he threw out there, "Who do you want to be?" – it just stuck with me. It made me realize that getting better isn't just about acing exams or learning software. It's also about building who you are as a person, what you believe in, and what your purpose is. He kept stressing how important your attitude is, how you bounce back from tough times, and how crucial it is to actually learn from your screw-ups. That totally changed how I see mistakes. They're not the end of the world anymore; they're just part of getting better. And when he talked about having a growth mindset, it was actually a relief. It's okay if I don't have everything figured out right now, as long as I'm willing to keep learning and changing. It's like he gave us permission to not be perfect but to always be striving to grow.</p>

                        <h3>Career Development</h3>
                        <p class="speaker-name">Speaker: MS. AILENE MAE M. PUSAG, MMT</p>
                        <p>Ms. Pusag's seminar was seriously eye-opening. It really hit me that just having the degree isn't going to cut it; we actually have to go out there and make things happen. She talked a lot about those "soft skills" – things like being emotionally smart, confident, and knowing how to communicate – which I honestly haven't given much thought to, being so focused on the technical stuff. Her challenge to push ourselves and take on leadership roles really resonated with me. It made me realize that getting comfortable isn't where the real growth happens. I also learned how crucial it is to keep learning even after we graduate – through webinars, getting certified, and just staying on top of what's new in the industry. But the biggest takeaway for me was how she talked about networking as something you build over time, not just a quick thing you do when you need a job. And her message about bouncing back from failures – seeing them as fuel instead of something to be scared of – was really powerful. I walked out of there feeling like I actually have the power to shape my career and become a better version of myself.</p>

                        <h3>Simplified Short Circuit Calculation</h3>
                        <p class="speaker-name">Speaker: ENGR. ROMOE QUISTRO</p>
                        <p>Engr. Quistro's seminar on short circuit calculations was seriously eye-opening. Honestly, before that, I just had this fuzzy idea of what electrical faults were all about. But the way he broke down the different kinds of faults and showed us how to actually calculate the fault currents step by step? It just clicked. I actually feel like I can do this now. What really struck me was that these calculations aren't just some boring thing we have to learn for school. They're actually super important for designing electrical systems that won't fry our equipment and will keep people safe. He really emphasized how much things like circuit breakers and relays depend on us getting these fault analyses right. That seminar definitely made me realize I need to take electrical safety way more seriously. I'm feeling really motivated to get better at fault analysis as I get ready to jump into my engineering career.</p>
