                        <p>Basic Engineering Design<br>Speaker: ENGR. SILVERIO G. DRIZ, JR.<br>Engr. Driz's seminar really opened my eyes to what basic engineering design is really all about, and how absolutely crucial it is for any engineering project to succeed. I used to think it was just about making drawings and layouts, but he showed that it's so much more than that. It's about actually solving real-world problems by thinking things through logically, doing the math precisely, and documenting everything thoroughly. What really clicked for me was when he talked about how important it is to really understand what the client needs and then turn those needs into systems that actually work and are safe. He broke down the whole design process step by step, from just getting the initial idea down to creating the detailed engineering plans. It made me realize that even small mistakes during the design phase can cause huge headaches later on, which really drives home the need to be super careful and pay attention to every little detail. The seminar made it clear that being a good designer means you need to be both creative and really disciplined. He also pointed out how important it is to communicate well, especially when you're working with engineers from different fields. Overall, the session really inspired me to take design tasks way more seriously and see them as a fundamental part of being an engineer, not just something we do for school.</p>

                        <p>CAREER ORIENTATION: Electrical Engineering in Engineering Procurement, Construction and Management EPCM Industry<br>Speaker: ENGR. VIEN  YSABEL A. JASA & ENGR. JOSEFINA C. VALENZUELA<br>That seminar with Engr. Jasa and Engr. Valenzuela totally widened my perspective on what electrical engineers actually do in the EPCM world. Before, I kind of just pictured us dealing with wires and power grids. But they showed how we're involved in everything – from the nitty-gritty design and planning to the budgeting, making sure everyone's on the same page, and even overseeing the installation and startup of these massive systems. The big thing for me was realizing how much teamwork and communication are involved. It's not just about knowing your electrical stuff; you're constantly working with people from all sorts of different backgrounds. They also stressed how crucial it is to get the whole project flow, what the clients actually need, and how the whole purchasing thing works – stuff you don't really learn in regular classes. It really hit me that just being technically smart isn't enough. To really nail it in EPCM, you've got to be able to adapt, manage resources like a pro, and handle those crazy deadlines. That seminar definitely motivated me to start working on my project management and people skills, on top of the technical side. It sounds like a tough but super rewarding career path.</p>
