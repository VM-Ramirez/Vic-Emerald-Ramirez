                    <p>Role of EE in Sustainable Development (Solar Compensation Mechanisms Implemented in the Global Energy Market)</p>
                        <p>Speaker: Engr. Annie D. Atienza, REE</p>
                    
                    <p>Engr. Annie Atienza's seminar really opened my eyes to what electrical engineers can do in the renewable energy scene, especially with solar. It wasn't just about the nitty-gritty technical stuff; she also talked about how crucial planning, system design, and even government rules are. The way she explained Net Energy Metering (NEM) and Net Billing totally clicked – seeing how those compensation things can really get people on board with solar power. But honestly, what also struck me was hearing about her own journey. From studying and doing research to taking on leadership roles and landing at a big global company like OpenSolar? That was seriously inspiring. It made me think about how important it is to get out there, join organizations, and just grab any chance to learn and grow. This seminar definitely gave me a push to work on becoming a well-rounded engineer, not just someone who knows the formulas.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mental Health Matters: The Importance of well-being in Achieving Success</p>
                    <p>Speaker: MR. IVER OLIN N. SONES</p>
                    <p>Mr. Iver Sones' seminar really hit home for me too. That whole "burnout is not a badge of honor" thing? Seriously changed how I'm looking at things. I used to think that the more stressed and sleep-deprived I was, the more I was accomplishing. But he made it so clear that constantly pushing yourself to the limit isn't something to be proud of—it's actually a red flag. It was so refreshing to hear him talk about the simple stuff – taking breaks, actually sleeping, eating properly, and reaching out when you need support. It sounds basic, but hearing it in the context of engineering, where the pressure can be insane, made it click. It's not just about getting good grades; it's about staying sane and healthy while doing it. What I really appreciated was how he talked to us. It wasn't some dry lecture; it felt like a real conversation with someone who gets it. And then, even the recap session the next week just hammered home those points. It really sunk in that looking after your mental health isn't just a side thing—it's absolutely crucial for being a good student now and a well-rounded professional later on.</p>
                    <p>Electric Grid Resilience and Power Recovery (Resiliency and Recovery of Electricity for Sustainability)</p>
                    <p>Speaker: ENGR. JANELLE ALVEYRA, REE, RME, SO2</p>
                    <p>This seminar deepened my understanding of how energy systems must evolve—not just through technological advancements, but by adopting a more proactive mindset. It wasn't just about new gadgets for energy; it was more about a whole new way of thinking. Resilience isn't just about picking up the pieces after things go wrong. It's about looking ahead and building a system that can handle anything, especially with all that wind, sun, and water power doing their own thing. That "Mix and Match" idea totally clicked – having local control, knowing what to do in an emergency, and actually planning for risks so we're not caught off guard when the power gets wonky. And the recovery part? Spot on about needing to jump into action fast to keep communities safe after a blackout. Plus, who knew electricity theft was such a big deal? It messes with the whole grid! It's not just about the tech; it's also about following the rules. That Republic Act 7832 really shows that keeping things sustainable means the law has to step in and everyone needs to be on board. Definitely gave me a lot to think about.</p>
                    <p>From Classroom to Career: Student's Career Expectations VS. The Reality of the Professional World</p>
                    <p>Speaker: ENGR. SIRACH B. CUENCA, REE, RME</p>
                    <p>Engr. Sirach Cuenca’s seminar gave me a more grounded and realistic view of what lies ahead after graduation. I used to think that a diploma was like a golden ticket to a comfy career, but he painted a much more realistic picture. It's not just smooth sailing after graduation; it's going to be a whole new ballgame with crazy deadlines, pressure cooker situations, and getting feedback left and right. But the cool thing is, he flipped the script on those challenges. Instead of being scared of them, he made them sound like chances to actually get better. The biggest thing I took away was that this first job isn't some final stop; it's just the starting line for learning that'll last our whole careers. He kept hammering on how important it is to roll with the punches, stay humble, and always try to level up ourselves – those things are just as crucial as knowing all the technical stuff. Then, when that other group did their recap, it just reinforced everything. They were talking about how it's okay to start small, keep our minds open to different things, and really start getting ready now. Honestly, the seminar totally lit a fire under me. I feel way more motivated to actually start thinking about my career path and go after it with some real purpose and be ready for whatever comes next.</p>
