                    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
                    <p>3D Modelling and Automation<br>Speaker: ENGR. ARIEL M. ROSALES<br>That 3D modeling seminar was a total game-changer for me! I always just thought of it as something for movies and games, but now I see it as this super important tool for us engineers. It's not just about making cool-looking stuff; it's about actually testing, tweaking, and seeing how our ideas will work before we even build anything real. Hearing about those simulations, like stress tests and airflow analysis, really blew my mind. It's like 3D modeling can help us catch mistakes early on and make the whole design process way smoother and cheaper. And the part about how these digital models connect with machines like CNCs and 3D printers to make real things? That was seriously fascinating. The speaker was awesome at explaining everything, and it totally got me pumped to start playing around with 3D design software myself. I'm actually really looking forward to the recap next week. I'm hoping we can dig even deeper into how 3D modeling is used in different industries. It would be cool to talk about the hurdles people face with the software and maybe even swap tips on how we can start using it in our school projects and eventually in our careers. This whole thing has really opened my eyes to how practical and innovative 3D modeling can be in the world of engineering.</p>
                    
                    <p>What's your StorEE? Basic Literature Discussions on Life<br>Speaker: MR. JOHN HAROLD D. VILLAREAL<br>This seminar showed me that it’s not just a literary device—but a powerful way to understand life itself.  I always thought of stories as just, well, stories. But the speaker made me see that storytelling is actually a fundamental way we make sense of life itself. It hit me that even those messy, confusing parts of our lives, like anxiety or just zoning out in daydreams, are all legit chapters in our own personal stories. And just like in books, the real growth often happens quietly, and who we become can take some really unexpected turns. The thing that really stuck with me was this idea that we don't have to have it all figured out right now. Life isn't some perfectly plotted novel, and it's totally fine if things don't go in a straight line. This talk actually helped me chill out a bit about my own journey and made me feel more connected to literature, like it's this mirror reflecting what it means to be human. I'm really curious about the recap session. It'll be cool to talk about how our own lives actually mirror story elements like plot twists, how we change over time, and how our characters develop. Hearing how other people see those things in their own lives will definitely make me appreciate storytelling even more, and just how differently everyone navigates life. This seminar definitely made me pay more attention to my own story – and feel more open to seeing how it all unfolds.</p>

                    <p>Automation Basic Course<br>Speaker: ENGR. ALLAN R. CAROLINO<br>That automation seminar was seriously eye-opening. I always kind of pictured those big industrial machines just doing their thing on their own, but now I get that there's a whole system of sensors and stuff telling them what to do. Learning about PLCs and DCS was a big takeaway for me—it's like they're the actual brains making all the decisions in real-time. There was this one analogy that really stuck with me; the speaker compared running a machine without monitoring to driving a car with no dashboard. That just made the importance of automation super clear. I also liked how they pointed out that it's not about robots taking everyone's jobs. It's more about making things safer, faster, and more reliable. And they really stressed that keeping these systems running smoothly with good maintenance is just as important as the technology itself. I'm definitely looking forward to the recap. I'm hoping we can get into the nitty-gritty of programming and troubleshooting, and see some more real-world examples of how automation is used. It'll be awesome to clear up any technical stuff I'm still fuzzy on, share some examples, and just feel more confident about this whole automation thing, which is obviously a huge deal in engineering.</p>

                    <p>OKAY NA TWO: Introspective and Interpersonal Qualities as Major Pieces of an Effective Leadership<br>Speaker: ENGR. JANLLOYD A. ESMILLO, SO2<br>That leadership seminar totally flipped my idea of what being a leader actually means. I used to think it was just about telling people what to do and making sure tasks get done. But the speaker really emphasized that it all starts with knowing yourself. Like, really understanding your own strengths, what you're not so good at, and what you truly believe in. Apparently, that self-awareness is key to making good calls and relating to people better. What really stuck with me was this idea that strong leadership is all about building real connections with people. Especially in engineering, where we're always working in teams, being able to actually listen, communicate clearly, and get people to trust you is just as important as being technically smart. The talk made me realize that understanding emotions – both mine and others' – is huge for growing, both as a person and in my career. It definitely got me thinking about how I interact with people, and it's inspired me to start working on those people skills so I can become not just a decent engineer, but someone who can really lead and connect with others.</p>

                    <p>Introduction to Industrial Automation: PLC and HMI<br>Speaker: ENGR. LOUIE VILLAVERDE<br>This seminar deepened my understanding of automation by introducing the powerful roles of PLCs and HMIs in modern industrial systems. I knew automation was a big deal, but I didn't really get how PLCs and HMIs were the powerhouses behind it all. It's like PLCs are the actual brains of the machines – taking in info from sensors, telling things what to do, and even talking to other machines. And apparently, they're way more dependable than those old-school relay systems. Then there's the HMI, which is basically how we humans talk to the machines. It makes controlling and keeping an eye on everything way simpler. What really clicked for me was learning about Ladder Diagram programming. Because it looks kind of like electrical circuits, all that complicated logic suddenly made a lot more sense. Even simple stuff like timers and counters showed me that you really need to think things through carefully, even for basic machine operations</p>
